## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ I am working on creating a predictive machine learning model that is trained on all the information available before the birth of Jesus Christ. My goal is to develop a model that can predict the birth of Jesus. Once the model successfully predicts this event, I plan to further develop it using historical data up to the present day, and then begin forecasting the future to identify potential negative and positive events.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data science, quantum machine learning, historical data analysis, and the ethical/philosophical aspects of AI to develop a predictive model that can analyze historical data and forecast future events.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on developing a predictive model that leverages data science, quantum machine learning, historical data analysis, and the ethical/philosophical aspects of AI to analyze historical data and forecast future events.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with developing a predictive model that leverages data science, quantum machine learning, and historical data analysis to forecast future events, but I need assistance with hardware resources as I currently lack the necessary computing power for training the model
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the mathematics and fundamental knowledge required to build distributed systems from scratch.
